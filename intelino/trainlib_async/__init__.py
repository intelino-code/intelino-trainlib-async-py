There are two variants of the **intelino trainlib**:

- Asynchronous library ``intelino-trainlib-async`` that uses the import
  ``intelino.trainlib_async``.
- Synchronous (blocking) ``intelino-trainlib`` that uses the import
  ``intelino.trainlib``.

They are very similar and share most of the code. The difference is mostly in
the :class:`TrainScanner` and :class:`Train` classes.
